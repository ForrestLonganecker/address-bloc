For the following situations, determine which search approach to use and why would you take that approach. Write your answers in the submission box below.

* Performing a search of a sorted by name IRS database for a taxpayer name

Binary search would be better in this situation, because the data is sorted, you can use that to your advantage and decrease the amount of time it takes to complete the task.


* Searching through an unsorted list containing the days of the weekend

Because the list is unsorted you will have to use iterative search.


* Given a list of the planets in the Milky Way in ascending order by size, search for a planet with a given size.

Since you are searching for the size in a set of data sorted by size this is another great use case for binary search.


* Searching for a checkpoint name in an unsorted list of Bloc checkpoints

Once again, this data is unsorted so you must use iterative search.


I imagine the simplest approach, as far as ease of implementation would be something along the lines of the sequelize .findOne() method.
